# Healthcare Data Analysis and Insights

## Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze healthcare data to uncover insights that can improve patient care and manage healthcare resources efficiently. Using Excel, I cleaned, transformed, and analyzed data to identify meaningful patterns.

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing healthcare datasets, including patient health profiles, medical histories, and healthcare costs. Insights from this analysis aim to help healthcare providers make better decisions about patient care and resource allocation.

## Key Features
    Data Sources: 3 healthcare datasets
    Tools Used: Microsoft Excel
    Focus Areas: Data cleaning, transformation, and visual analysis

### Data Cleaning and Transformation
    Techniques Used: Mean, median, and mode for cleaning data.

### Patient Segmentation:
    BMI: Categorized patients as Underweight, Healthy, Overweight, and Obese.
    Blood Sugar: Classified patients as Normal, Pre-Diabetic, and Diabetic.

### Data Analysis Highlights
    Smoking and Cancer Risk
    Non-smokers had higher cancer histories than smokers, showing smoking isnâ€™t the only factor.
    Overweight and obese patients were more prone to cancer.
    Blood Sugar and Surgeries
    Most obese and overweight patients were diabetic or pre-diabetic.
    Patients with high blood sugar levels had more surgeries.

### Hospital Charges
    Obese patients incurred higher hospital charges even with normal blood sugar levels.
    Tier 2 hospitals showed higher charges, possibly due to limited resources.
    Older patients (60+) faced significantly higher healthcare costs.

## Key Excel Techniques
    Data Cleaning: Mean, Median, Mode functions.
    Segmentation: Conditional formatting to group BMI and blood sugar levels.

## Visualizations:
    Donut Chart: Smoking vs. Cancer history.
    Column Chart: Hospital charges by region.
    Line Chart: Age vs. hospital charges trends.

## Visualizations
    Donut Chart: Smoking vs. Cancer Risk
    Column Chart: Hospital Charges in Tier 2 Cities
    Line Chart: Trends of Hospital Charges by Age

# Conclusion
This analysis emphasizes the importance of healthy weight and blood sugar levels to prevent diseases and reduce healthcare costs. Tier 2 cities need better healthcare infrastructure and awareness to lower hospital expenses.
